Hi! I'm a software engineer building open source web3 products.

**Adventure Cards NFT**
- Built a tool to browse NFTs for the project, released hours after launch
- Currently building an onchain/offchain hybrid [card game](https://github.com/Adventure-Cards/game-client)

**eth-plays-snake** (in progress)
- A fully on-chain collaborative game of snake

**[Other web3 ideas I'm thinking about](https://gist.github.com/0xOlias/f3be85188e86ff0fe91a6a6e0e821231)**

Please get in touch with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xOlias) if you want to chat :D
