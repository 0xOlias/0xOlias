Hi! I'm a software engineer building open-source web3 products. Here's what I've been up to lately:

**Adventure Cards NFT**
- Built a tool to browse NFTs for the project, released hours after launch
- Currently building an onchain/offchain hybrid card game

**eth-plays-snake** (in progress)
- A fully on-chain collaborative game of snake

**nft-notify** (in progress)
- A simple tool to "follow" a wallet and receive alerts for on-chain activity

**Other web3 ideas I'm thinking about**
- Dead-simple, open-source library for sign-in-with-ethereum
- Etherscan-style source code verification for traditional web services
- Twitch Plays Pokemon with inputs/votes provided as eth messages (or txns)
- Wallet authentication for traditional web services (why do I need an email to use GitHub?)
- On-chain billing (and permissions) for SaaS (why does my DAO need a credit card to pay for Vercel?)

Please get in touch with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xOlias) if you want to chat :D
