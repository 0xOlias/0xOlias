Hi! I'm a software engineer building web3 stuff. Reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xOlias) if you want to chat :D

## Current projects

### Ethereum Plays (soon!)  

### watercolor  
A dev server for building [artblocks](https://www.artblocks.io/)-ready projects with p5 and TypeScript support

### Adventure Cards  
I built a tool to browse Adventure Card NFTs released hours after launch, and then I built a minimal onchain/offchain hybrid [card game](https://github.com/Adventure-Cards/game-client)  

## Things I'm thinking about 
- Anti-botting/sybil resistance for fully on-chain games
- High-availability NFT metadata indexing
- "World-boss"/collaborative on-chain games & events
- NFT de-financialization experiments
