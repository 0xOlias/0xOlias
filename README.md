Hi! I'm a software engineer building web3 stuff. Reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xOlias) if you want to chat :D

## Recent work

### ethereum plays
A crypto game ([in progress](https://twitter.com/ethplaysxyz))

### watercolor  
A local development server for building [artblocks](https://www.artblocks.io/)-ready generative art projects with p5 and TypeScript support

### Adventure Cards  
I built a tool to browse Adventure Card NFTs released hours after launch, and then I built a minimal onchain/offchain hybrid [card game](https://github.com/Adventure-Cards/game-client)  

## Other stuff I'm thinking about 
- Anti-botting/sybil resistance for fully on-chain games
- "World-boss"/collaborative on-chain games & events
