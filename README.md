Hi! I'm a software engineer building web3 stuff. Hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xOlias) if you want to chat :D

## Current projects

### Adventure Cards  
I built a tool to browse Adventure Card NFTs released hours after launch, and then I built a minimal onchain/offchain hybrid [card game](https://github.com/Adventure-Cards/game-client)  

### watercolor  
A dev server for building [artblocks](https://www.artblocks.io/)-ready projects with p5 and TypeScript support  

### Ethereum Plays (soon!)  

## Interests
